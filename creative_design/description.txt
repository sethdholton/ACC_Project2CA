I used rule 30 to make a MIDI pattern for a drum kit in Ableton. I planned on trying multiple rules but I ran out of time, so I used the one that I thought would have an interesting sound without being too busy. I had to shorten the algorithm because there were only 16 sounds in the kit that I used. I could've given it more sounds, but I didn't have enough time to and I thought it hit the sweet spot between boring and busy.
